Introduction
------------
AWR Guided Help is implemented through a local web server running on the same machineas AWRDE. This server (currently implemented in python) receives URL's and uses them to execute CGI scripts (also currently implemented in python) which connect to AWRDE through COM to execute actions.

In order for Guided Help to work you must first install Python and some Python extensions as well as set some Python environment variables.
