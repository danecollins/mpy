These are the steps for generating the NI import template

0) delete the files "output.csv" and "logfile.txt"

   * Check that about 480 mapping entries were read in
   * Check that the differences were small

6) Double-click on output.csv (it should open in excel)

7) In the same excel open the "AWR JE Template_upload" file

8) Copy values only from output_split.csv to the upload template
   * The output_split.csv file splits out the allocations out from G&A into benefits & building maintenace, per NI request


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*If a manual split is needed, use output.csv file and perform the following:

1) sort by account #; find #95005 for allocations in & out and add 12 rows to allocation 95005 to:
	60% #61096 --> other benefits
	40% #67095 --> misc bldg

by inserting formula to calc 60% & 40% then copy paste special to eliminate formula dependency, then transfer other info and delete original 95005 rows
