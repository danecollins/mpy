These are the steps for generating the NI import template

1) make sure "account_map.txt" is up to date (Cindy and Juliet)	

2) Drag the 61-9 .txt file on top of the "RUN_ME.bat"
3) Check log file
	Number of lines - this is the total output lines (around 700 to 800)
	Sum of all output - this should = 0
	Number of companies processed = total number of AWR entities

4) Double-click on output.csv (it should open in excel)
     (Compare to report 14.4EY)

5) In the same excel open the "AWR JE Template_upload" file

6) Copy values only from output.csv to the upload template
   * The output.csv file splits out the allocations out from G&A into benefits & building maintenace, per NI request


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*If a manual split is needed, use output.csv file and perform the following:

1) sort by account #; find #95005 for allocations in & out and add 12 rows to allocation 95005 to:
	60% #61096 --> other benefits
	40% #67095 --> misc bldg

by inserting formula to calc 60% & 40% then copy paste special to eliminate formula dependency, then transfer other info and delete original 95005 rows
